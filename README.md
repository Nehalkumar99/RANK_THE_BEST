# RANK_THE_BEST
A django web app where everything best in a category or question is ranked by the users. It helps a user gain quick insight about the resource they are looking for and their popularity among people more experienced with those type of resources. 
It helps people look up quicly what best in the category if an looking for, For example maybe suddenly i need to design a logo for my project and i don't know what is used by other people for logo desiging so instead of researching on various website i may gain quick insight from this app what's used by most peole in the category i fall in.
WORK IN PROGRESS
